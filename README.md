# WebSite

You can access the website under https://stephanydev.herokuapp.com/.
The development of this website is under process but is deployed on Heroku for now.

The code in this repository is the code used in my portfolio website, a Single Page Application developed in ReactJs and Materialize, currently the development is under progress.

The basic structure of the file was created using create-react-app.
The routing of pages was done using react-router-dom library.

Available Languages on the website: Portuguese and English.

The website does not contain a back-end currently.

# Style

I used Materialize CSS libraries to add style to the component, so I would have more control on the style and at the same time be more productive developing the site. Since Materialize contains a lot of components ready to use and css defined and responsive.
