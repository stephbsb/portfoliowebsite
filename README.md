# WebSite

You can access the website under https://stephanydev.herokuapp.com/.

The development of this website is under process but is deployed on Heroku for now.

The code in this repository is the code used in my portfolio website, a Single Page Application developed in ReactJs and Materialize, currently the development is under progress.

The basic structure of the file was created using create-react-app.
The routing of pages was done using react-router-dom library.

The goal is to have the website in Portuguese and English, but for now only portuguese version is available.

The website does not contain a back-end currently.
